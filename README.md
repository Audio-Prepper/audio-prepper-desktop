# Audio Prepper
Still under active development and far from finished.

## The Why?
There are just too many videos out there that have bad audio due to that the audio levels are not balanced enough. And it's definitely not that easy as someone that doesn't understand audio that well, how to level and master your audio for platforms like YouTube. Probably most of YouTubers do not know how to use the LUFS value (or even what it is) or how to properly read the audio meters inside their editing software.
## Goals
1. Make it as easy as possible to have the best audio you could have from what you already have. 
2. Giving advice how to avoid those problems from the beginning. Recording tips, which effects to use with which settings in the editing software, etc ...

## Todo
- [ ] build a propper job system, so files do not disappear from the view.
- [ ] clean up render and main process code.
- [ ] add propper types :)
- [ ] implement the declicking & declip filter from ffmpeg
- [ ] add some options for declicking, declipping, compression, limiting
- [ ] implement an experimental version of "auto mix/balance"
